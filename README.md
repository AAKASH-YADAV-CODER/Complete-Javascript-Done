This branch of the repo contains starter files and final code for all sections and projects of the course


### Q1: What VSCode theme are you using?

**A:** I use Monokai Pro for all my coding and course production. It's a paid theme (I', **not** affiliated with them), but you can actually use the free demo version forever ðŸ˜…

**A:** Sure! Here you go:

- [Pig Game] (DOM Manipulation)
- [Bankist](Arrays, Numbers, Dates, Timers. Fake "log in" with user `js` and PIN `1111`)
- [Bankist Site] (Advanced DOM and Events)
- [Mapty] (OOP, Geolocation, Project planning)
